# Intro to Exploratory Data Analysis

This respository contains a short tutorial-style exploration of data analysis techniques using pandas and matplotlib. It is taken from a historic VAST challenge (details here: https://vast-challenge.github.io/2024/about.html). 

It includes examples of:

- Data cleaning and transformation
- Summary statistics and visualisation
- Basic plotting (histograms, scatter, time series)
